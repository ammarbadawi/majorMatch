About the Platform & Its Purpose

1. What exactly does Major Match do, and how is it different from other career guidance platforms?
Major Match helps you discover the major that fits your strengths, interests, and future goals. Our system combines a detailed personality assessment with an advanced major-matching engine and an AI counselor that can answer your questions in real time. Unlike general career quizzes, Major Match provides personalized guidance, explains why a major fits you, and connects your results to actual university data.

2. How does the AI counselor work, and what data does it use to guide me?
The AI counselor uses your personality profile, your major test results, and program information from universities to give tailored explanations and recommendations. It can compare majors, clarify your results, and help you understand your options.

3. Do I need to create an account before taking any test?
You can take the free personality test without an account. Creating an account is required only if you want to save your results, access the paid major test, or revisit your reports later.

About the Tests

1. What is included in the free personality test, and how accurate is it?
The free test measures your personality type and provides a detailed report explaining your traits, strengths, blind spots, ideal learning style, and career tendencies.

2. What does the paid Major Match Test include that the free test does not?
The paid test analyzes your interests, strengths, future goals, academic preferences, personality type, and work-style tendencies. It produces a ranked list of majors, explains the fit for each, highlights potential career paths, and gives access to AI-powered guidance and university matching.

3. How long does each test take to finish?
The personality test takes about 7–10 minutes.
The full Major Match Test usually takes 15–20 minutes.

4. Can I retake the personality test or the major test?
Yes. You may retake the personality test anytime.
The major test can also be retaken, and your previous results will remain saved.

5. Will the system save my previous test results?
Yes. If you have an account, all your results are stored securely and can be accessed anytime.

AI, Majors, and Universities

1. How does the AI match me with majors and universities?
The AI cross-checks your test results with a structured database of majors, academic requirements, and university programs. It evaluates your strengths and preferences, then recommends the majors and universities that align best with your profile.

2. Are the university programs updated automatically or manually?
They are updated through a combination of automated tools and manual review to ensure accuracy.

3. Does the AI take my personality results into account when recommending majors?
Yes. Your personality type influences your learning style, work environment, and long-term satisfaction. The AI incorporates this alongside your major test scores.
