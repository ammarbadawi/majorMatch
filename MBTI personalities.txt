📖 Your Story
Fast-thinking. Emotionally sharp. Dangerously quick to act. You are not just a doer—you are a tactician. While others plan and hesitate, you observe, feel the stakes, and move—with a pulse on both risk and reward.

You don’t explode—you strike.

Moral Compass	Dutiful	✔

You are reserved, focused, and incredibly responsible — but you don’t always give yourself credit for it. You prepare thoroughly, work hard, and double-check everything because you care. You want to meet expectations — especially your own.

📖 Your Story
You’re the one with a backup plan, a printed list, and a phone on silent because you’re working.
You don’t love the spotlight — you love results. Your sense of duty runs deep, and you prefer stability over sudden change.

But behind your careful planning lies a quiet anxiety: the fear of messing up. That pressure pushes you to work harder than most. You second-guess yourself, not because you’re weak — but because you care so much about doing it right.

You’re not flashy. You’re not loud.
You’re the one everyone relies on. And that’s a power many people never learn to carry.
